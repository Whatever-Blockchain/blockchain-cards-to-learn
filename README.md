# Blockchain Cards to learn

React, Typescrpt dapp to learn how to communicate with smart-contracts in several blockchains. Source codes of contraccts are managed in other [repos](https://github.com/orgs/Whatever-Blockchain/repositories) in this oraganization.

you can see the result of each card by clicking the `button`.
`Card` means a component that contains some functions to communicate with each blockchain's remote rpc node, although default network is localhost in this dapp. 



## Usage
Because the default network setting is localhost, you need to run local network of each blockchain and
deploy contracts in other [repos](https://github.com/orgs/Whatever-Blockchain/repositories) to each blockchain's local network.
